                <p>Hey! I'm Julian, a Swiss-Australian software engineer, problem-solver, and card game enthusiast. I love figuring out how things work—whether it's fixing broken systems, building cool projects, or developing new competitive strategies. My favorite tasks are the ones that seem impossible until you crack them.</p>
                <p>If you're looking for freelance web design or programming help, want to collaborate on something creative, or need a versatile problem-solver for your startup, let's connect! I'm always excited to tackle interesting challenges and build something extraordinary.</p>

                        <p>I spent a year building this epic cuttlefish-inspired squid robot at ETH Zürich. My focus was solving the control system for the robot—figuring out how to translate a forward motion of a joystick into the complex synchronised motions the fins would have to make to get the robot to move like the human wants it to. This required creating a physical model of the robot's behaviour and writing the software to make it behave as desired. Seeing the robot swim as expected for the first time was magical.</p>

                        <p>I grew up a gamer kid, but a very transcendent moment for me was that first time I clicked on a StarCraft map editor and realised I could make my own. As a teenager I'd spend my spare time modding games I loved but thought could be made better—teaching myself many skills including programming in the process. Years later my journey of moving between games ended with competitive Magic: The Gathering, a game that combined creative design and gameplay through deck-building. Yet even there I felt called to do more and eventually designed my own Magic: The Gathering set for me and my friends based on pop culture elements I liked. I'm very proud how fun and cohesive that turned out from the start.</p>

                        <p>Automation is another one of my passions. When I was using online platforms to sell Magic: The Gathering cards, I built a tool to automate the pipeline from receiving orders to having finished stamped and customs certified letters. That required teaching myself how to build web crawlers as there were no accessible APIs. This was a fun and very satisfying experience for me that saved me many hours of tedious work. The code's on my GitHub if you're curious—but fair warning, it wasn't written with other people in mind.</p>
